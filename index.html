         <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Daniel Miron Ocampo</i></p>
         <p class="w3-justify"> My name is Daniel Miron Ocampo, I am a senior in cyber security engineering. My plan is
            to find a job in the cyber consulting industry and to better myself as a cybersecurity pentester. My college
            journey has not been easy, I will miss Iowa State, but I am happy that it is coming to an end and that I can
            move on to the next stage of my life. If I could somehow restart my college career, I would not choose a
            different major or go down a different path. I would still pursue the same degree but push myself to do
            better. Talking about cyber security is my hobby and my passion, I love teaching others about it and taking
            the time to do a little research in my free time. When I am not eating or sleeping, I am learning about bug
            bounty hunting or catching up with the news in the cybersecurity world. After college I will find the time
            to participate in live hacking events and meet fellow hackers, perhaps collaborating on mutual projects or
            forming a small consulting group that does pentesting work. </p>

            <p class="w3-justify">After my summer internship at Werner Enterprises, I decided to stay part time as a
               Security Operations
               associate. I work with the security analysts on configuring DLP policies, building successful
               anti-fishing campaigns and writing security-process oriented documentation for the team. I have learned
               about the importance of good oral and written communication skills when working remotely, in addition to
               many technical skills that I have picked up while training on how to use Google Chronicle as a SIEM/SOAR
               solution. I am very grateful for being asked to stay on part-time because I have picked up a lot of
               skills for which there is no coursework. </p>

                  tasks to help the security team in their compliance efforts. One of my main responsibilities was to
                  conduct third party risk management evaluation assessments on vendors on behalf of Werner. It was
                  critical to stay organized and communicate effectively with team members across different departments
                  to minimize risk for the enterprise. I got a better sense of what working in a corporate environment
                  is like and thoroughly enjoyed this summer internship experience. </p>

               <h3>CPRE 381 </h3>
               <p class="w3-justify"> In one of the most challenging classes of my college experience. I had to work
                  with my team member to
                  develop three varieties of a MIPS based processor. With a single-cycle, multi-cycle and pipelined
                  architecture. This was all to be done in VHDL. The most complicated part of the project was that the
                  final product depended on the very beginning of the class. So, you could very easily spend hours and
                  hours fixing a simple mistake you made at the start of the semester without much experience. I was in
                  charge of developing the control unit and the fetch logic. While my lab partner worked on the
                  arithmetic
                  unit. The MIPS single cycle processor was designed to fetch decode and execute instructions based on
                  the
                  MIPS ISA which would sometimes write back to an address field. The end-product was built from the
                  ground
                  up from simple logic gates to complex processor module units. I learned how to keep everything
                  organized
                  and how to take advantage of modularity and encapsulation the small units had to work properly before
                  they could be used to build something more complex. I also learned the importance of perseverance and
                  patience, nothing in this project worked right the first time so our team had to constantly fight and
                  learn from our mistakes. Resources used included GitHub, Visual Studio and our TAs.</p>
               <h3>COM S 309 </h3>
               <p class="w3-justify">In this course our team learned about the software development lifecycle in
                  addition to building an
                  ecommerce-based app called Thrifty. This app was designed to help thrift store owners show off and
                  sell their merchandise. It was meant to connect customers and clients in the same geographical area,
                  since thrift stores rarely have the capabilities to ship their items to their customers. My role was
                  as frontend Java developer, I Implemented Agile management principles to design a marketplace on
                  Android Studio. And established secure SDLC practices to reinforce the security of team project. I
                  learned about the importance of slow but steady meaningful progress. I also learned how to design an
                  app on android studio. Resources used included Android Studio, GitHub and Springboot for backend. </p>
               <h3>Cyber Curriculum Developer </h3>
               <p class="w3-justify">In this project I developed an interactive cyber security curriculum for high
                  school students. I
                  Prepared students with the skills required to participate in a cyber defense competition. The modules
                  I designed included content covering web app security, Wireshark, Metasploit and essential networking
                  principles. My role was to develop the technical content while another student worked on how to best
                  introduce this to students from an instructor's point of view. The skills I learned were to be very
                  detail oriented and to explain my steps thoroughly since my audience were beginner high school
                  students. I also learned about how to teach technical things in an enthusiastic way to keep people
                  interested and engaged. The resources used included OneDrive and OWASP Juice Shop. </p>

            <h2 class="w3-wide">Senior Design</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify">My senior design project has to do with securing the PowerCyber virtual infrastructure
               using an open
               source or commercial SIEM framework. The two options we are looking at include Gravwell and
               SecurityOnion. We will then pentest our defense structure and incorporate machine learning to detect and
               mitigate attacks that our SIEM does not recognize. My role in the project is project organizer in
               addition to implementing the SIEM solution into the PowerCyber architecture. In this first semester I
               have learned a lot about securing virtual assets and keeping the project organized so we do not lose
               track of information or details when our team looks back on past progress. I have learned about how to
               use MITRE caldera as an adversary emulation platform and how to use an open-source solution such as
               SecurityOnion to customize the best defense perimeter for cyber defense purposes. My big picture
               contribution is to keep our team on track for success and to coordinate team meetings and to make sure
               every individual on our team understands their responsibilities. As of now we are still working on the
               engineering design portion, but I look forward to overseeing the completion of the final product.</p>

            <h3>General Education Reflection</h3>
            <p class="w3-justify">
               The general education courses were some of my favorite classes at Iowa State. I learned numerous life
               lessons without being too stressed out about my grade. The four general education electives that I will
               be
               covering are ENGL 314, RUS 378, HDFS 276 and SPAN 378x. I took ENGL 314 in the spring of 2020, the
               semester
               everyone was sent home because of the pandemic. When I started that school year, I never imagined I would
               take my finals at my parent’s house. This course puts a heavy emphasis on technical communication. I had
               the
               opportunity to practice my writing skills with an assignment that involved writing a technical manual for
               a
               process. The process could be about anything we were interested in. I decided to base it on a
               weightlifting
               bench I made with my dad. Since there was little to do during the pandemic, I thought I could take care
               of
               two projects at once and use the final product to work out while I was indoors. Throughout the project I
               learned the importance of communicating a complex process in simple and easy to understand instructions.
               A
               skill that I will continue to make use of well into the future. At my part time-job I have authored a lot
               of
               documentation for the information security team, where I must ensure that I include every step that’s
               important. The second general elective, RUS 378 was a class about studying Russian films, which quickly
               became one of my all-time favorite courses. I never thought I would enjoy Russian cinema so much. While
               it
               is unnecessary to go over the content of the movies, the lesson here is that if we always stay within our
               own bubble, we never learn anything new or expand our minds. More than ever before, people all over the
               world should take the time to explore each other’s culture and traditions. And understand that there are
               more things that we have in common instead of differences that drive us apart. After I went through RUS
               378,
               I took a great interest in Russian language and culture. I even learned the Russian alphabet from
               watching
               YouTube videos and forced my friends to watch some of the movies I found amusing. I went down a long
               rabbit
               hole of Russian knowledge all thanks to this class and I developed a greater appreciation for my general
               education electives. I enjoyed this Russian film class so much that I decided to take the Spanish
               department’s version of it. SPAN 378 had the same structure but with Spanish movies. Fortunately, I speak
               the Spanish language so not a lot of meaning was lost in translation, and I was exposed to several movies
               I
               had never heard of. I grew up in the United States, so I was rarely able to speak Spanish outside of
               home.
               Which is why I missed out on a lot of aspects of Mexican life, by taking this class I was able to
               reconnect
               with my roots and learn more about other Central and South American Spanish speaking cultures that may
               not
               necessarily be Mexican. After spending nearly ninety percent of my life in the U.S. I have lost touch
               with
               some of what makes me Mexican, this class made me realize the importance of remembering where I came from
               and how different my life would have been if my parents had decided to stay in Mexico. It makes me have a
               greater appreciation for the things that I have been blessed with as an American. It is unlikely that I
               would have had the money to learn and do so many of the things that make me who I am today. It is
               important
               to be a person with a mindset of gratitude and one that helps others who may not be as fortunate in the
               world, that is the lesson I learned from taking this film class. Finally, HDFS 276 is a human sciences
               class
               I took in my sophomore year about human sexuality. The most important thing this class taught me is how
               to
               look after your own health. At some point in the semester the professor invited a guest speaker and he
               spoke
               to us about his journey surviving testicular cancer and how his life changed after that. Hearing about
               all
               he had to live through taught me the significance of looking after yourself and that you don’t have to
               wait
               until you are forty-five years old to start checking yourself for signs of bumps and odd symptoms. The
               speaker was a young man in his thirties who never expected to deal with a condition like that at his
               young
               age. And although no one deserves to go through something like that, he said it taught him a lot about
               learning to appreciate life and good health. This is relevant to me because it was almost two years ago
               that
               my cousin Alex was treated for the same condition. It was heartbreaking for our entire family to see his
               health decline every single day. Thankfully he survived and has improved dramatically since that awful
               era.
               With cancer hitting so close to home I learned to be more alert of early warning signs and take my health
               into my own hands. Especially nowadays with greater numbers of younger people being diagnosed with cancer
               and other life-threatening conditions. Other than giving students a break from their technical core
               classes,
               the purpose of general education classes is to introduce students to new ideas and topics. This is the
               reason why I enjoyed these courses so much. They gave me a new outlook on life and the world. In life,
               throughout my engineering career I will run into other engineers and coworkers from all different
               backgrounds. It is important to try to understand their stories and their background, it brings us all
               together and exposes us to a range of new things we perhaps would never know that we would like. While
               this
               might not help us solve complex world problems it does help us understand another person’s struggle and
               that
               at the end of the day, we’re all on the same ship trying to stay above water. </p>

            <h3>Ethics Reflection</h3>
            <ol>
               <li>What is the purpose of having and following a Code of Ethics?</li>
               <p class="w3-justify">When I was a kid, I once asked my mother, how the United States could regard itself
                  as the freest
                  country
                  in the world when countries like Mexico, have more relaxed laws and regulations. As a sidenote, I
                  lived
                  in Mexico for two years. What my mom said in response amazes me to this day, especially since she
                  never
                  had a formal education. She said that it is thanks to the rule of law and a fair and level system that
                  enforces its regulations which has facilitated so much economic and societal progress. This brings us
                  back to the question at hand. The purpose of having and following a code of ethics is to protect
                  people
                  and their ideas, in that order. When we have a code of ethics people are encouraged to be creative
                  without having to worry about their work being stolen or used to harm others. The two World Wars of
                  the
                  early 20th century proved that science and engineering could be used for good and evil, for right and
                  wrong. Engineers and scientists have a moral obligation to do what is good and just. Especially
                  because
                  they possess an incredible amount of powerful knowledge.
               </p>
               <li>When you are faced with an ethical situation, how do you, personally, go about making a decision?
                  What
                  factors are involved in you making a decision? Be specific.</li>
               <p class="w3-justify">In high school I learned about three types of ethics schools, deontological, virtue
                  and
                  consequentialist.
                  Out of the three, I found it very difficult to support consequentialist ethics. Under this theory, the
                  consequence of a decision has the most weight to determine whether an action was right or wrong.
                  However,
                  there is no way to know for certain what type of consequences a decision might have days or weeks down
                  the road. As an example, you could give money to someone on the street but then what if they use it to
                  buy a knife to threaten and steal from others? Are you still sitting on moral high ground? When faced
                  with an ethical situation I have to embrace deontological ethics. Which follows the notion that there
                  are
                  rules and principles we must all adhere to distinguish right from wrong. I must humble myself and
                  admit
                  that I am far from perfect and that there are things others know that I do not understand, which is
                  why I
                  delegate that responsibility to another entity that is perhaps far more knowledgeable and just than
                  myself. I consult with other people, people that have higher authority and can be more objective in
                  their
                  approach to my issues. As an example, I would do my due diligence and assess the situation from a
                  legal
                  standpoint. Will my actions break national or state laws? Will my job security be jeopardized because
                  I
                  breached my contract? I do not see virtue or consequentialist ethics as a viable approach to answer
                  ethical questions.
               </p>
               <li>What case study was discussed in your small group? How did the ethical considerations introduced by
                  your
                  group members differ from your own? How were they alike? Was your group able to come to a consensus on
                  what would be the most "ethical" decision?
               </li>
               <p class="w3-justify">The case study we discussed was whether information stored on devices such as the
                  amazon Alexa could
                  be
                  used against you in a court. I personally could never justify having one of these devices in my home.
                  Smartphones, TVs and even laptops are already invasive enough, but having a microphone in your home
                  which
                  could simultaneously receive and transmit is only a few steps removed from being a telescreen. It is
                  not
                  controversial to say that anything you say in the privacy of your own home should not be held against
                  you. No one deserves to feel unsafe in their house. Other people weighed in differently stating that
                  depending on the severity of what was said you should be held accountable. But I strongly disagree,
                  because then who draws that line? Amazon? In many criminal cases, electronic devices are looked into
                  to
                  find evidence of a crime, but that is after the fact. If you do something illegal, then you may be
                  searched but if you are an innocent citizen going about their life then listening to your online
                  activity
                  is not an ok thing for the state or law enforcement to do.
               </p>
               <li>Reflect on the "Virtue of Ethics" as it relates to the case study your group discussed. Choose three
                  of
                  the six virtues that you feel are most related to your case study and briefly write about them. Why
                  did
                  you choose the three that you did? How are they relevant to the case study? Why are the other virtues
                  less relevant? Is there another ethical virtue you feel could apply to your case study that is NOT
                  included in the "Virtue of Ethics?" Why or why not?</li>
               <p class="w3-justify">The three virtues that are most related to my case are integrity, honesty and
                  self-discipline. Tech
                  companies in the modern era are willing to do anything that makes them a quick buck, if the law is not
                  specifically in place to protect the consumer from it. This type of behavior is not ok, in the Alexa
                  device spying case. Amazon has no integrity and thinks it is ok to listen in on people's conversations
                  if
                  it means they can make a better shopping recommendation but that shows how little respect these
                  companies
                  have for society. They make cheap products full of bugs and vulnerabilities, make no effort to protect
                  customer information and when a breach happens, they are not honest and sincere in helping out the
                  people
                  affected. Another ethical virtue that was not included is respect and responsibility. They do not take
                  action until it is too late, or they are put in the spotlight for their wrongdoings. When is the last
                  time companies like Facebook or Nike stood up to China to demand respect for the Uyghur people? They
                  never call out the CCP because that’s who pays them and they would not be able to sell their products
                  to
                  millions of people if they stood up for what was right. In the tech sphere, it continues to be the
                  wild
                  west and unfortunately a lot of these giant companies have so little integrity that they don’t do the
                  right thing unless they are called out, and by the time that happens. It’s already too late. Companies
                  need to have the self-discipline to do the right thing and police their own activities. </p>

            <h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3>
            <p class="w3-justify">I began my college journey in the summer of 2017 as a member of the APEX program. This
               was a very unique
               opportunity where I got to live in Ames, take classes and meet new people during the summer session.
               Thanks
               to this program, I earned a few credits to kickstart my degree and became more confident in my academic
               abilities. Programs like APEX are so important to people like me because as the first person in my family
               to
               go to college, I needed all the help I could get. I could not ask my parents or an older brother for help
               or
               guidance. I had to figure everything out for myself. Fortunately, the program had a strong network of
               peer
               mentors and college liaisons that would be there to lend a helping hand. I hold a deep sense of gratitude
               for the people that made a program like APEX possible for me and so many others. However, none of this
               would
               have happened if I didn’t take charge of my education as a Senior in high school. That will be a running
               theme throughout the next several years, and a core value that I hold strongly.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-justify">
               During my freshman year I wanted to take chances and try new things. Which is why I joined Airforce ROTC
               and
               started to work at the dining center. Both extracurricular activities tested my ability to wake up early
               and
               stay awake. Never had I done so much exercise, my body was exhausted. After a semester I unenrolled from
               the
               program but I was proud of how much I had accomplished, I felt lighter, more alert and I rarely fell
               asleep
               in class despite getting up so early. My academic performance in my first semester was also solid. The
               summer after freshman year I did not think I would be qualified enough for an engineering internship
               which
               is why I opted to study abroad in Germany. It was a risky move because as a freshman I was low on cash,
               and
               I had never been outside of the country on my own. But I decided to go for it anyway and experience
               something new. During this study abroad I received credits for a few courses and learned what it was like
               to
               explore a new country. Since Germany is a country that is still considered to be part of the West, there
               wasn’t much of a culture shock. A good number of people were also English speakers, so I didn’t have much
               trouble when I was lost. The only challenging part was trying to speak their language. I had previous
               German
               language classes before the trip but could not piece together anything too complex. During the summer
               session I took a technical elective where I had to work in a team to implement and optimize an assembly
               line
               project. The assignment was challenging for me since it was designed to be a senior level course but
               fortunately my German teammates were better coders than I was, and I could ask them for help or advice to
               complete my assigned portions. It was one of many valuable lessons I would learn in college, that life
               would
               often present me with obstacles that I am unprepared to face, but with time, willpower and perhaps some
               luck
               I can make sense of what is being asked and be successful. As a sophomore I kept taking chances and
               seeking
               new opportunities, in the fall of 2018 I decided to apply to become a chemistry tutor, which was a
               subject I
               felt comfortable with. While I was nervous, I combated these feelings by doing my reviewing the concepts
               and
               preparing good problems that my tutees would find helpful. In the end I improved my communication skills
               and
               made some extra money for my work. The summer of 2019, I was able to secure my first internship
               experience
               at a company called Eurofins Scientific, this was back when I was still a chemical engineering major. I
               was
               part of the vitamin analysis team, and even though I had a good understanding of basic chemistry I was
               learning a lot of new information every day. By the end of the internship, my notebook was full of notes
               and
               data that was too technical to be covered in a college course. Since I had to make sure that everything,
               I
               did was documented I had to be good at keeping organized and neat records for the other lab technicians.
               Despite this I still made mistakes and anytime I did I always found it better to admit it and ask someone
               more knowledgeable for assistance. Never did I attempt to hide or lie about what I had done. During my
               junior year I continued to work at the dining center and began to seriously struggle with my upper-level
               classes. It was during this time that I decided to switch out to my current major, cyber security
               engineering. I had a tough time justifying my interest in a career in the chemical engineering field.
               This
               was one of the best decisions I have ever made in college. I have never looked back with any sort of
               regret
               and continue to love cyber security more as I have progressed throughout my degree. I cannot say that any
               of
               this has been easy. Getting to the point at which I’m at right now has taken a lot of perseverance. Even
               during my low points, I would still go to class, apply for internships, go to the career fair and do my
               best
               to keep getting closer to my goals. After a while I was able to secure my first cyber related internship
               at
               a transportation company. While it was challenging, I enjoyed the learning process. I woke up every
               morning
               and I felt nothing but excitement to get to the office and see my coworkers. Before this internship, I
               had
               never worked in an environment where people liked their jobs, people at Werner Enterprises were kind and
               patient. They enjoyed sharing their knowledge and would take the time to understand the issues.
               Throughout
               my internship everything I had learned from courses, labs, YouTube videos and guest speakers was finally
               coming together. I had the privilege of leading security presentations for new hires, creating
               documentation
               for the security team, all to keep company information secure. Aside from my routine work, we were
               grouped
               together with other interns to develop a team presentation which had the focus of attempting to provide a
               solution to any one problem within the enterprise. My team’s presentation was about providing alternative
               energy source options to engine idling. While I won’t go into project specifics, our project involved a
               lot
               of research, talking to department leadership and practice to get it right and have the presentation
               memorized. It was nerve wracking to present in front of about 100 other company employees including
               senior
               leadership. I knew it was going to be challenging but it was a big learning moment. After this summer
               internship I decided to stay and continue working with the security team through the fall 2023 semester.
               It
               can sometimes be a little overwhelming to have a job and deal with my schoolwork, but I make it work
               because
               I understand the value of having professional experience. As I wrap up my final year at Iowa State, I
               continue to make progress on my senior design project. An initiative I am really looking forward to
               involves
               developing a defense framework for a virtual power grid called PowerCyber. Our group is still in the
               491-design phase so there is a lot of planning and initial setup that needs to be done but we are on our
               way
               to implementing it. I have had a good journey at Iowa State, but I am looking forward to being done and
               one
               day starting my career as a cyber security engineer. I am planning to seek a role within the security
               operations team where I can be involved with incident response and keeping a company’s information safe
               from
               cyber criminals.
